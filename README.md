# Visualizing_Filters_CNN

One of the advantages of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision tasks is that they can automatically learn features from raw input data. However, it is often difficult to understand what these features represent. Visualizing the filters of a CNN can help us understand what features the network has learned and how they are being used to make predictions.

In this notebook, we will use the VGG16 model to visualize the filters of a convolutional neural network.
